            <span class="bolded coloured2">highest alcohol consumption per capita</span>
            in <span class="bolded coloured">2019</span>. This is due to price of alcohol, specifically beer is cheaper than bottled water as well as a unique drinking culture

        <h3>Which countries are ranked at the top for producing wine in the past years?</h3>

          There is a series of changes on the
          <span class="bolded coloured2">rank of wine production</span> over the past
          years. The interactive chart below shows the

        <h3>What is the volume of wine production for each top 10 wine producing countries?</h3>
        <p>
          According to the below visualisation, 
          <span class="bolded coloured2">Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ </span> are the 
          <span class="bolded coloured2">top three producers</span> for wine worldwide in 2016.
          In the same year, 
          <span class="bolded coloured2">Italy</span> produced around 
          <span class="bolded coloured">45.6 million hectoliters</span> of wine, making it the 
          world's largest wine production for 2016. Italy is known as a wine-producing powerhouse
          as more than 400 types of grapes are grown across 20 winemaking regions. This helped 
          Italy take the global top spot in terms of the amount of wine produced and putting itself 
          at second place when it comes to exports.
