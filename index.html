            There have been a series of changes on the

          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bolded coloured3">Italy</span> is <span class="bolded coloured3">one of the largest wine producers in the world</span>. The quality of Italian wine, in addition to the winemaking tradition, 
            is due to the particular territory from a geographical and climatic point of view which has favoured the spread of a wide range of wines. The <span class="bolded coloured3">quality of wine</span> is 
            <span class="bolded coloured3">significantly influenced by</span> a number of different factors, including, the <span class="bolded coloured3">quality of the vine</span>, <span class="bolded coloured3">climate and soil quality</span>, and the 
            <span class="bolded coloured3">technology of maturation</span> and <span class="bolded coloured3">production of wine</span>. Its history and the conformation of the territory, mainly hilly, makes <span class="bolded coloured3">Italy the land most suitable for quality 
            viticulture with over 300 different types of vines</span>, which are located in vineyards spread throughout every region, from north to south, including islands (Lucamarini, 2021).

            <h2>How Different Wines Are Being Made?</h2>
            <p>
              Winemaking is the production of wine, starting with the selection of grapes, fermentation into alcohol and the bottling of the finished liquid. 
              The <span class="bolded coloured3">main wine categories</span> are
              <span class="bolded coloured6">White</span> and <span class="bolded coloured5">Red Wine</span>. 
              <span class="bolded coloured6">White wine</span> is primarily <span class="bolded coloured6">made with white grapes</span>, and the skins are separated from the juice before the fermentation process while
              <span class="bolded coloured5">Red Wine</span> is <span class="bolded coloured5">made with darker red or black grapes</span>, and the skins remain on the grapes during the fermentation process. 
              <span class="bolded coloured3">Dry wines</span> contain residual sugar with <span class="bolded coloured3">less than 1%</span> and wines containing residual sugar with <span class="bolded coloured3">more than 10%</span> are considered as <span class="bolded coloured3">sweet wines</span> (Fadamitan, 2022).

                In general, wine contains <span class="bolded coloured2">70% of water</span>, 
                <span class="bolded coloured2">20% of ethanol</span> and <span class="bolded coloured2">10% of 
                other ingredients</span> such as <span class="bolded coloured2">sugar</span>, <span class="bolded coloured2">
                acids</span> and <span class="bolded coloured2">phenols</span>. 
                Acidity in wines can range from <span class="bolded coloured3">extremely sour</span> at around 
                <span class="bolded coloured3">2.5 pH (high acidity)</span> to <span class="bolded coloured3">very flat</span> 
                at around <span class="bolded coloured3">4.5 pH (low acidity)</span>. According to Puckette (2022), 
                <span class="bolded coloured">white wines tend to have higher acidity than red wines</span>. 
                This is due to the <span class="bolded coloured3">ripeness of the grapes</span>. <span class="bolded coloured7">Cooler climates</span> produce <span class="bolded coloured7">highly acidic wines</span> with very little naturally occurring sugars.

                On the other hand, <span class="bolded coloured8">warmer climates</span> often <span class="bolded coloured8">produce wines with lower acidity</span>. The <span class="bolded coloured3">high temperatures cause grapes to ripen rapidly, reducing the naturally occurring
                acids and increasing the sweetness of grapes and resulting wine</span> (McKenzie, 2020).

                The <span class="bolded coloured2">average glass of wine contains about 11% to 13% alcohol</span>. However, different wine varieties contain a different amount of alcohol. The 
                visualisation below displays the <span class="bolded coloured2">range of alcohol content in terms of Alcohol By Volume (ABV)</span>. Drinkers will notice that the back of their 
                mouth or throat will feel warm due to the alcohol consumed. A <span class="bolded coloured3">wine with a greater ABV</span> would <span class="bolded coloured3">taste bolder and warmer</span>, almost as if the palate
                were being slightly burned. According to the visualisation below, <span class="bolded coloured13">Sweet Sherry</span> has the <span class="bolded coloured9">highest alcohol by volume</span> while <span class="bolded coloured14">Champagne</span> and <span class="bolded coloured14">Sparkling

            <span class="bolded coloured11">Pinot Noir</span> is the world's
            <span class="bolded coloured5">most popular light-bodied red wine</span> in <span class="bolded coloured5">2017</span>.
            Itâ€™s loved for its red fruit, flower, and spice aromas that are accentuated by a long, smooth finish.
            Pinot Noir pairs particularly well with duck, chicken, pork, and mushrooms. Besides that, it is considered 
            as the <span class="bolded coloured3">best red wine for beginners</span>. 

            On the other hand,  
            <span class="bolded coloured12">Chardonnay</span> is the  
            <span class="bolded coloured6">most popular white wine</span> worldwide in <span class="bolded coloured6">2017</span>.  
            Chardonnay is made in a wide range of styles from lean, sparkling Blanc de Blancs to rich, creamy white wines aged in oak.
            Chardonnay is usually paired with meaty fish (halibut, cod) and shellfish (lobster, shrimp, crab, scallops). It is also
            now the <span class="bolded coloured3">most widely planted white grape variety, globally</span> (Puckette, 2022).

              (Vivino, 2022). However, do keep in mind that <span class="bolded coloured3">some varieties of wine are more expensive than others, even if the quality of the wine is the same</span>. For example, there is a <span class="bolded coloured3">high market

              We can see that <span class="bolded coloured15">Uganda</span> has the <span class="bolded coloured2">highest alcohol consumption per capita in litres</span>. An interesting finding is that 
              although <span class="bolded coloured3">Singapore</span> has a <span class="bolded coloured3">higher GDP Per Capita</span> but its <span class="bolded coloured3">alcohol consumption per capita is 2.03 litres</span> which is <span class="bolded coloured3">lower</span> compared 
              to <span class="bolded coloured3">Luxembourg</span> that is <span class="bolded coloured3">12.94 litres</span>. <span class="bolded coloured">Czechia</span> with the <span class="bolded coloured">population of 10,534,598</span> has a <span class="bolded coloured">very high alcohol consumption per capita </span> 
              which is <span class="bolded coloured">14.45 litres</span>, making it the <span class="bolded coloured">second highest</span> in the list. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the visualisation, it is safe to say that <span class="bolded coloured3">European countries</span> traditionally have a <span class="bolded coloured3">higher amount of alcohol consumed per person</span>, 
                12 of the top 15 are in Europe. It is also shown that <span class="bolded coloured3">Asia</span> in general consumes a <span class="bolded coloured3">lower amount of alcohol</span> compared to the other continents.
